# Statistical-Analysis-of-a-Heart-Disease-Dataset
the aim of this study is to identify the physiological indicators that significantly differentiate, in statistical terms, between patients diagnosed with heart disease and those without the condition. Additionally, the study explores the potential to construct a statistical classifier - a highly accurate predictive model - for the presence of heart disease based solely on measurable clinical physiological parameters.
To this end, data from 270 patients were analyzed, including 150 individuals diagnosed with heart disease and 120 healthy individuals. A range of statistical tools were employed, including the Shapiro-Wilk test, the Mann-Whitney U test, and the Chi-square test. Subsequently, a logistic regression model was constructed using physiological variables only.
The data analysis revealed that patients with heart disease tended to exhibit higher resting blood pressure, elevated cholesterol levels, lower maximum heart rate, and higher oldpeak values. Statistically significant differences were also observed in chest pain type, resting electrocardiographic results, ST segment slope, the number of major vessels occluded as seen in angiography, and thallium stress test outcomes. In contrast, fasting blood sugar levels did not show a statistically significant difference between the groups.
The predictive model demonstrated excellent performance, achieving an accuracy of 94% and an AUC value of 0.929. The most influential risk factors associated with the probability of heart disease were the number of occluded vessels, an abnormal thallium stress test result, and the presence of exercise-induced chest pain.
